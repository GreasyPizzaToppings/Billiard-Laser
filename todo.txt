bugs:
- sudden spike in memory and segfault crash
- cueball contour length negative overflow. nondeterministic. 
- cueball null or image null. maybe related to video format (clipchamp helps?). nondeterministic.


better way to add frames to raw and processed queues

UI redesign. main form, make cleaner. hide/show shot tracking stats

better media controls

put more video processing code into VideoProcessor

way to make it faster at higher res / increase performance

update fps label when replaying shots too. and for camera input


**debug form:
fullscreen/bigger picturebox viewing 

implement toggle start/stop ball detection instead of just start

make loading/resetting easy without closing form

work on still image or paused video/camera. re-detect with changed image settings

understand DI and interfaces
