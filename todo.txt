bugs:
- sudden spike in memory and segfault crash (solved?)
- cueball contour length negative overflow. nondeterministic. (solved?)
- cueball null or image null. maybe related to video format (clipchamp helps?). (solved?)

- SHOT disposes of all frames after a while.
- load video 1 and play, fine. load video 2. plays video 1, and memory usage only goes up!. need to clear out old video
- fps decrease when keep replaying same video. shouldnt.

manage disposing for:
- ball detector


use multithreading: have ui thread only do ui stuff. have other threads do image processing for speed and efficiency. have to make classes thread safe


better way to add frames to raw and processed queues

UI redesign. main form, make cleaner. hide/show shot tracking stats

better media controls

put more video processing code into VideoProcessor

way to make it faster at higher res / increase performance

update fps label when replaying shots too. and for camera input


**debug form:
fullscreen/bigger picturebox viewing 

implement toggle start/stop ball detection instead of just start

make loading/resetting easy without closing form

work on still image or paused video/camera. re-detect with changed image settings

understand DI and interfaces
