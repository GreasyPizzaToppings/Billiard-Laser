1 cueball detection
2 shot detection





bugs:
- raw frames sometimes get disposed of. happens when replaying video several times


use multithreading: have ui thread only do ui stuff. have other threads do image processing for speed and efficiency. have to make classes thread safe


UI redesign. auto resize. hide/show shot tracking stats

better media controls

put more video processing code into VideoProcessor

way to make it faster at higher res / increase performance

update fps label when replaying shots too. and for camera input




**debug form:
fullscreen/bigger picturebox viewing 

implement toggle start/stop ball detection instead of just start

make loading/resetting easy without closing form

work on still image or paused video/camera. re-detect with changed image settings

understand DI and interfaces
