done:
1: clean up ui, remove unused buttons (yagni)
remove shot graph stuff (yagni)
fix fps label
fix pause/playback
refactor playback mechanism
fix async bug with 2 loaded videos
fix async bug load video while playing shot
fix start camera after playing video / vice versa
fps counter buggy with camera input. plus nan 

todo:
implement ball replacement helper (to actually achieve mvp)

2: figure out what images u want on debug form 
3: implement real shot detection (1 ball start moving - all balls stop) 
4: improve cueball tracker/path tracer

ideas:
cueball tracker: implement some logic to prevent snapping away from moving cueball. find best contour closest to expected path

cueball tracker: on a completed shot, if path isnt smooth, go back in time and find a different contour at the jump point to find a better fit

currently loads whole video in memory before taking maxFrames from it into queue. make it only load in maxFrames to memory to prevent crashes on big videos

bugs:
- crashed once when resising window while replaying shot. 'parameter invalid' on the application.run(new billiardlaserform()) and sometimes elsewhere
