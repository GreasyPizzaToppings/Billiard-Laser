todo:
1: clean up ui, remove unused buttons (yagni)
bonus: fix pause/play button
2: figure out what images u want on debug form 
3: implement real shot detection (1 ball start moving - all balls stop)
4: implement ball replacement helper (to actually achieve mvp)
5: improve cueball tracker/path tracer

ideas:
cueball tracker: implement some logic to prevent snapping away from moving cueball. find best contour closest to expected path

cueball tracker: on a completed shot, if path isnt smooth, go back in time and find a different contour at the jump point to find a better fit
